# cdiggins.github.io

This is the web-site for my ([Christopher Diggins](http://cdiggins.github.io)) home page and blog.

The blog is built from Git-flavored markdown sourced and Mustache (CTemplate) style template files using tools I created with the [Myna parsing library](https://github.com/cdiggins/myna-parser). 

## License 

The entire tool chain (and contents) are licensed under the MIT license. 

## Depdendencies

In order to build the web-site you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed. Once these are installed the other dependency will be the [myna-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/myna-parser)
which can be installed by using `npm install` command.
