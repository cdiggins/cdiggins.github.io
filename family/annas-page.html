        <h2>Cool facts about Jojo Siwa.</h2>

        <p>
                JoJo Siwa is a singer, dancer, and YouTube personality. She first became famous beacause of a dance 
                competition show called Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition. Now she is 14 years old!! Her favorite color is glittery 
                pink. I think her dog Bow-Bow is really cute. What I like about her are the bows and the outfits. I just 
                love glitter too. Make  sure to check out her vlog on YouTube if you are a JoJo fan like me.  
                I bet you would really like JoJo's #1 hit BOOMERANG, so I put it here for you to listen to.
