# Acknowledgements 

I've just completed a major overhaul of this web-site and it dawned on me how much free and open technologies and tools were involved in making the site and the Myna parsing library. I figure it would be worthwhile to take a minute to give some credit where credit is due. 

**Static Blog Generators** - The idea for this site came from the technology used by the following static blog generateors:

* [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Octopress](https://www.octopress.org)

**Editors** - I spend a lot of time typing into these tools 

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  

**Learning Resources** - I don't know that I could accomplish anything without the plethora of free information available on these sites. 

* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
* [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
* [Mozilla JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)

**Styling, Presentation, and Programming Frameworks** - Trying to make a blog not look like complete garbage is hard. I found these frameworks help! 

* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)
* [Font awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

**Hosting Services** - A lot more free hosting options are available today than in the past: 

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [MaxCDN](https://www.maxcdn.com/)

**Languages, Compilers and Package Managers**
