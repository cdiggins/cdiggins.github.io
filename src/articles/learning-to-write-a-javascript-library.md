# Learning to Write a JavaScript Library

Starting a year ago I decided I wanted to restart the Heron programming  language project by implementing it in a combination of JavaScript/GLSL. To start with I needed a parsing library, after evaluating the existing JavaScript parsing libraries with the help of [Mathieu Guay-Paquet](https://github.com/mguaypaq) I decided that there was definitely an opportunity to create my own. As a result [the Myna parsing library](https://github.com/cdiggins/myna-parser) was born. 

This article is about my adventure trying to  write an open-source JavaScript library. 

## Navigating the JavaScript Ecosystem 

>> "the Javascript ecosystem is a confusing mess, as far as I can tell." - Mathieu Guay Paquet

When Mathieu (one of the smartest people I know) worked with me this was one of his principal findings. He is right. In developing the Myna library I had a lot of adventures. 

## JavaScript or TypeScript or DART or Flow or CoffeeScript? 



## What Flavor of JavaScript to use 

## NPM 

To release or not on NPM? 

## What Libraries to Depend on 

I decided early on to make Myna self-contained. This makes the project more attractive as a drop-in component for developers, and helps avoid the exponential explosion of depdencies that can occur. 

## The Tools I Learned 

* Chrome developer tools
* Node.JS
* Visual Studio Code
