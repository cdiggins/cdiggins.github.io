# First Post!

Welcome to my the first post of my new blog. Over the last 15 years I've had blogs in different location across the interwebz: 

* [Area.Autodesk.com](http://area.autodesk.com/author/christopher-diggins)
* [Artima.com](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=cdiggins)
* [Doctor Dobbs Journal](http://www.drdobbs.com/author/Christopher-Diggins)
* [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=1295110)

Since I have been getting back into [open-source development](https://github.com/cdiggins) with projects like
the [Myna parsing library](https://github.com/cdiggins/myna-parser) I decided to host this blog on GitHub at [cdiggins.github.io](http://cdiggins.github.io). 

The blog topics will cover a range of subjects related to the craft of programming and software development, as well 
as 3D graphics and animation. 

If you have ideas for a particular blog post please [send me a note](mailto:cdiggins@gmail.com).
