# First Post

Welcome to my new blog. My name is Christopher Diggins. I'm a software developer with an unhealthy obsession with programming languages and software engineering. 
Previously I've had blogs in different location across the interwebz: 

* Area.Autodesk.com
* Artima.com
* O'Reilly
* MSDN
* Doctor Dobbs Journal 

## Programming and Software Development

Like most of my other blogs, the subject matter will be mostly related to programming and software development, and my adventures developing open-source libraries
and programming languages. 

If you have ideas for blog topics, please [send me a note](mailto:cdiggins@gmail.com).
