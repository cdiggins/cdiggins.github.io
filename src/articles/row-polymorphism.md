# Row Polymorphism

I am working on a type-inference algorithm that extends basic Hindley-Milner
type inference with row variables for type lists and a limited form of recursive types.

Most articles on row polymorphism discuss it in the context of record types, however 
my interest is in using row variables to capture arbitrary changes to a stack. 

One advantage or Row polymorphism is that in a stack-based language all function can be 
expressed using a single type (S1 -> S2)

Things that might be novel: 

1. using row variables for stack operations in a functional stack-based language
1. providing a practical and simple implementation of HM extended with stack variables
1. explaining type checking and type inference to any programmer 
1. implementing a shader language without the need of explcit types 
1. dealing with cycles in a type-inference algorithm
1. because of row polymorphism having only one signature for all "apply" forms regardless of the number of arguments 
1. using row polymorphism to have a universal compose 
1. Modeling stack effects using row polymorphism  

Things that I could do:

1. write a technical report
1. write technical journal articles that are outside of the typical domain (joining up different domains)
1. moving type theory outside of PLDI PLAI PLOP etc. 
1. adding meta-programming to a type system 

What I want:

1. Teach at a university
1. Publish important computer science papers
1. Contribute to the state of the art of computer science 

Papers I could write:

1. Modeling stack effects using row polymorphism
1. Writing an efficient R-D parser without memoization 
1. Extending HM with Row Polymorphism 
1. Type Level Computation 
1. Implementing the SK Calculus in a Concatenative System
1. Lambda Calculus to Concatenative Calculus
1. Typing the Concatenative Calculus
1. Origins of a Concatenative Calculus
