# Things to do 

- [ ] compare the JSON performance with other tools
- [ ] start work on the optimizer 
  - [ ] get the myna-parser CSV parser faster than Papa parse 
- [ ] more sample grammars and tools
    - [ ] write a commented-JSON parser and a tool, strips comments from JSON. 
    - [ ] finish the "C++ comment" parser 
    - [ ] write a parser for Github flavored markdown (GitMarkdown)
    - [ ] finish the JavaScript tokenizer 
        - [ ] interactive tester 
        - [ ] special test function . . . given some JavaScript generate tokens 
- [ ] figure out how
