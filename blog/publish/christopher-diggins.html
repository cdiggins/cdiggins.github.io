<h1>About Christopher Diggins</h1>
<p>
I love computer programming. I have been doing this for over 30 years. I currently work at Autodesk as a Principal Software Developer. I also am apparently addicted to blogging and writing open-source code. 
Perhaps I have Luc Devroye to blame for this. A brilliant lunatic of a computer scientist at McGill who was the first person to pay me to write code. When I asked him about the ownership and licensing of the code I was writing for him he terminated the contract immediately. 
I'm always trying to get better at programming, but I have a strange way of doing it. I either look for languages that make it easier for me, or I dream up new languages that would be easier to use. 
I think this is because I understand algorithms, data-structures, and software architecture, but I am quickly bored with low-level details of how to use particular languages or frameworks correctly. It's not that I don't know anything about this stuff (you have to learn a few things), it's just that I find it a wasteof time. I believe that as software developers we should be able to focus on the details of how to make our software components work together, or how to create algorithms that have good complexity rather than worrying about whether or not my C++ class is exception-safe and that I have deallocate objects in the correct order. 
This search for purity and simplicity has lead me down the path of using functional programming, immutable data-structures, task-based parallelism,dataflow programming models, and fancy stuff like that. Fun thing is that it still applies no matter what language you use.

<h2>How I got started</h2>
<p>
My dad bought the family an Atari 400 in 1984. Once I got sufficiently bored playing Pac-Man and Centipede I decided to give this "Basic" game a try.It turned out to be something where you could code any game you could imagine.
