		let slogans = `a troubled mind
		raging against the machine
		being unreasonable
		paddling upstream
		out of the box thinking
		difficulty interfacing with normals
		adapting his surroundings to himself
		not playing well with others 
		programming computers 
		being confused by people
		screaming in his head
		imagining data structures		
		half-heartedly trying to fit in
		pretending he gets it
		excited about computer programming 
		doing things the hard-way 
		successfully reinventing things 
		playing with legos 
		try to grok technology
		lacking focus
		looking for patterns 
		horriby misunderstood 
		filled with angst 
		trying to be better 
		taking things to the extreme
		struggling with work-life balance
		rehashing old material
		making grammatical mistakes
		procrastinating
		trying to figure it out
		getting high on coffee
		making 1-off mistakes in his code
		debugging floating point errors
		designing odd programming languages 
		plugging into the matrix
		trying to decide which pill to take
		unstable
		acting 12
		not being funny
		running with scissors
		geeking out
		acting inappropriately
		avoiding adulthood
		talking with his mouth full
		setting a bad example
		not reading between the lines
		being impulsive
		raised by wolves
		worrying his parents
		paddling upstream
		coloring outside the lines
		poking it with a stick
		causing trouble
		not doing what he is told
		avoiding normalcy
		seeking a dopamine rush
		challenging authority
		doing things the hard way
		forgetting to take his meds	
		either manic or depressed
		acting inappropriately
		lacking filters
		autodidacting
		going with his gut
		shooting from the hip
		keeping it real
		barely holding it together
		faking it		
		not sticking to the script`.split(/\r?\n/);
